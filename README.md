I've installed [Linux Mint Cinnamon Edition](https://linuxmint.com/download.php) on my system.


## Keyboard
To use the same mac keybindings (⌘+C for copying, ⌘+V for pasting, ⌘+L to jump in the adress bar, ..) you can use the program [kinto](https://github.com/rbreaves/kinto). It runs in the system tray and works without configuration splenditly. 

## Touchpad
To use multi-touch gestures on your touchpad I have installed [touchegg](https://github.com/rbreaves/kinto)
